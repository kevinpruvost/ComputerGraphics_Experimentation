# Computer Graphics Experimentation

This repository is dedicated to the coursework for "Fundamentals of Computer Graphics" at Tsinghua University during the Spring semester of 2024.

The projects undertaken in this course will cover various subjects, including:

- Mesh Subdivision & Simplification
- Ray Tracing
- Human Skin Rendering

These projects will be implemented using OpenGL, Vulkan, and DirectX11 at minimum, with the possibility of incorporating DirectX12 if time permits.

## Project Structure

The project is currently a work in progress (WIP) and is organized as follows:

- **DLLs Related to Context APIs:** This project compiles DLLs related to context APIs, such as GLFW or Win32 native Windows API.

- **DLLs Related to Graphics APIs:** DLLs related to graphics APIs, including OpenGL, Vulkan, DirectX11, and potentially other APIs in the future.

Further documentation will be released in the near ending phase of the project.

## External Libraries

The following external libraries have been brought into the project:

- **[glad](https://github.com/Dav1dde/glad):** An OpenGL loader generated by the glad tool.

- **[glfw](https://github.com/glfw/glfw):** A multi-platform library for creating windows, contexts, and handling input.

- **[stb_image](https://github.com/nothings/stb):** A single-header library for loading images in various formats.

- **[yaml-cpp](https://github.com/jbeder/yaml-cpp):** A YAML parser and emitter in C++.

- **[glm](https://github.com/g-truc/glm):** A header-only C++ mathematics library for graphics software based on the OpenGL Shading Language (GLSL) specifications.

Feel free to explore these repositories for more information on each library.
